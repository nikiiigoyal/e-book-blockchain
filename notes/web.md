# Differece between Web 1.0 , Web 2.0, web 3.0

*Web 1.0 (1990s - early 2000s)*

-Read-only websites where you could only view information
-example: Early Yahoo homepage, company websites with just text and basic images
-Static pages that rarely changed

*Web 2.0 (2000s - present)*

-Interactive websites where you can create, share, and connect
-examples:
Facebook (post photos, comment, like)
YouTube (upload videos, subscribe)
Amazon (write reviews, rate products)
Wikipedia (anyone can edit)
-both a reader AND creator
Key feature: Social interaction, user-generated content

*Web 3.0 (emerging now)*

-Decentralized internet where you own your data and digital assets
Real examples:

Cryptocurrency wallets (you control your money directly)
NFTs (you own digital art/collectibles)
Decentralized social media (no single company controls it)

Key feature: **Blockchain technology**, ownership, no central authority.

## Centraliesd , peer2peer, Distributed Architecture
 *Centralised*  
 -One place controls everyhting
 -All requests go through central server
 -Examples: Facebook, Gmail, Netflix, Traditional banking

Advantages: 

Simple to understand and implement
Easy to update (change once, affects everyone)
Quality control and consistency
Centralized security management

Disadvantages:

Single point of failure
Bottleneck with high traffic
Easy target for censorship
Privacy concerns (one company has all data)
High infrastructure costs

*Peer2peer*
-Shared among all participants
-Direct connections between peers
Examples: BitTorrent, Bitcoin, Early Skype

Advantages 

No single point of failure
Scales with more users
Censorship resistant
Cost-effective (no central servers)
Load distributed naturally

Disadvantages 

Discovery problems (hard to find content)
Security risks (direct IP exposure)
No quality guarantee
Complex to implement

*Distributed* 
-Single organization, multiple locations
-Coordinated across multiple servers
Examples: Google Search, WhatsApp backend, CDNs

Advantages:

High availability and fault tolerance
Better performance through geographic distribution
Scalable to handle massive loads
Load balancing capabilities
Data redundancy

Disadvantages 

Complex to design and maintain
Consistency challenges
Higher infrastructure costs
Network latency between nodes
Difficult debugging

Real-World Examples

Google Search: Thousands of data centers worldwide
CDNs: YouTube videos stored near your location
WhatsApp: Messages replicated across multiple servers
 
### Modern Hybrid Approach : combining.

-Blockchain Networks
P2P: Direct node communication
Distributed: Ledger replicated everywhere
Decentralized: No central authority
